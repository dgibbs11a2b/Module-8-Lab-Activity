Here is a description of each Python program, its respective file name, and its intended purpose.

1.	Problem1EqualorNot.py – This program contains a function that takes two input from a user and prints whether the numbers are equal or not.

2.	Problem2SumofTen.py – This program contains a function which takes two input from the user, calculates the sum, and then prints to the screen whether the value is less than, greater than, or equal to 10.

3.	Problem3NumList.py – This program will take the existing list and print to the screen if the value 5 exists in that list.

4.	Problem4LeapYear.py – This program will take the user’s input in the form of a 4-digit year and will return True if it is a leap year, and False if it is not a leap year.

5.	Problem5CharacterList.py – This program will execute a check on the character’s existing list of items needed against items already in their possession and will also check against current status debuffs.
